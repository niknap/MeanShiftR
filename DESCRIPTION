Title: Tree delineation from lidar using mean shift clustering
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Nikolai Knapp
Maintainer: Nikolai Knapp <nikolai.knapp@ufz.de>
Description: The package allows individual tree crown delineation (ITCD) from 
	airborne laser scanning point clouds (lidar) using the Adaptive Mean Shift 
	3D (AMS3D) clustering algorithm described by Ferraz et al. (2016). It 
	further	contains functions for parallelization of the clustering and post-
	processing such as fitting polygons around tree crowns and matching 
	detected crowns with stem positions on the ground.
